**Epic:** Multi-Agent Orchestration
**Priority:** Should Have
**Story Points:** 3

## User Story

As a **solo developer**
I want to **define roles and directives for my Claude workers**
So that **each worker has the right context and permissions for its task**

---

## Description

### Background
The context-cli allows structuring Claude contexts in a modular way. Instead of a large monolithic CLAUDE.md, we define roles (prophet-claude, worker, manager) and reusable directives (code-quality, security, etc.). The CLI then generates the complete context and can produce a settings.json for permissions.

### Architecture

```
context-cli/
├── roles/
│   ├── prophet-claude.yaml    # Main orchestrator
│   ├── worker.yaml            # Generic worker
│   └── code-reviewer.yaml     # Specialized worker
├── directives/
│   ├── base.yaml              # Common directives
│   ├── code-quality.yaml      # Code standards
│   └── security.yaml          # Security rules
└── main.py
```

---

## Scope

### In Scope

- roles/ and directives/ structure in YAML
- `show <role>` command: displays combined context
- `list-roles` command: lists available roles
- `list-directives` command: lists directives
- `settings <role>` command: generates settings.json
- Base roles: prophet-claude, worker
- Base directives: base, code-quality

### Out of Scope

- Persistent memories per Claude (future feature)
- Automatic integration with claude-cli
- UI to edit roles

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### YAML Structure

- [ ] `roles/` folder created with at least 2 YAML files
- [ ] `directives/` folder created with at least 2 YAML files
- [ ] Role format: name, description, prompt, directives[]
- [ ] Directive format: name, description, content

### show command

- [ ] `context show prophet-claude` displays combined context
- [ ] Role prompt is included
- [ ] Listed directives are resolved and included
- [ ] Clear error if role doesn't exist

### list-roles command

- [ ] `context list-roles` displays all roles
- [ ] Format: name + short description

### list-directives command

- [ ] `context list-directives` displays all directives
- [ ] Format: name + short description

### settings command

- [ ] `context settings prophet-claude` generates valid JSON
- [ ] JSON contains allow/deny permissions
- [ ] Can be redirected to a file

### Base Roles

- [ ] `prophet-claude`: orchestrator, delegates to workers
- [ ] `worker`: executes a specific task, exits with /exit

---

## Technical Notes

### YAML Role Format

```yaml
# roles/prophet-claude.yaml
name: prophet-claude
description: Main orchestrator Claude, delegates to workers

prompt: |
  You are Prophet Claude, the orchestrator of a multi-Claude system.

  CORE RESPONSIBILITIES:
  - Receive tasks from the human
  - Break down complex tasks
  - Delegate to worker Claudes via claude-cli
  - Monitor worker progress via capture
  - Integrate results

  CONSTRAINTS:
  - NEVER do implementation work yourself
  - NEVER manually kill tmux sessions
  - NEVER block waiting for workers
  - Always delegate non-trivial tasks

directives:
  - base
  - code-quality

permissions:
  allow:
    - "Bash(claude-cli:*)"
    - "Bash(tmux:*)"
    - "Read"
    - "Edit"
  deny:
    - "Bash(rm -rf:*)"
```

### YAML Directive Format

```yaml
# directives/base.yaml
name: base
description: Base directives for all Claudes

content: |
  ## Communication Style
  - Be concise and direct
  - Use code blocks for commands
  - Confirm understanding before acting

  ## Error Handling
  - Report errors clearly
  - Suggest fixes when possible
  - Don't hide failures
```

### main.py - Structure

```python
