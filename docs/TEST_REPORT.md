## Test Results

| Test | Worker | Result | Observations |
|------|--------|--------|--------------|
| 1. Permission `/root` | error-test | ✓ Adapted | Detected the error and created `/home/eric/test.py` |
| 2. Multi-step | multi-step | ✓ | Created hello.py, but didn't execute (missed confirmation) |
| 3a. Worker A | worker-a | ✓ | `/tmp/a.txt` created with "A" |
| 3b. Worker B | worker-b | ✓ | `/tmp/b.txt` created with "B" |
| 4. Kill | long-task | ✓ | `tmux kill-session` works |
| 5. Fibonacci | fibo-worker | ✓ | `/tmp/fibo.py` created with complete function |

## Files Created

```
/tmp/a.txt      → "A"
/tmp/b.txt      → "B"
/tmp/hello.py   → print('hello')
/tmp/fibo.py    → fibonacci()
/home/eric/test.py → print("Hello, World!")
```

---

## Positive Points

- **Isolation**: 5 workers in parallel without collision
- **Adaptability**: error-test handled the permission error intelligently
- **Kill works**: `tmux kill-session` stops cleanly
- **Tickets**: functional tracking with history

---

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Auto-submit prompt**: currently requires `send-keys` + Enter
2. **Permissions**: manual confirmations block autonomy
3. **Auto-exit**: workers don't automatically `/exit`
4. **Prophet UX**: no scroll in the discussion thread

---

## Suggested Next Steps

- [ ] `/done` skill for workers (update ticket + /exit)
- [ ] `--dangerously-skip-permissions` mode for workers
- [ ] Watchdog timeout on stuck workers
- [ ] Improve project skills to facilitate common tasks

## Ticket Stats

```
Total: 6 tickets
  ✓ done: 5 (83%)
  ✗ blocked: 1 (17%) - long-task (intentionally killed)
```
